# Python Random Module
- built-in module that can be used to generate random numbers
- that are pseudo-random - they are not truly random

# Slicing strings
- this syntax can be used to return a range of characters

# String format
- takes passed arguments, formats them and places them in string
- where placeholders {} are

# len()
- built-in function that returns the length of an object

# Looping through lists
- can use for loop
- you can reference the index numbers using range() & len() functs to create suitable iterable(s)
- while loop: use len() to determine list len, start at 0 and loop through list items by referencing indexes
-           : always increase index by 1 after every iteration
- comprehension: offers shortest syntax for looping through lists

# List Comprehension
- offers shorter syntax for creating new list based on values of existing lists
-

# Sort List
- sort() method that alphanumerically sorts a list in ascending order by default
- sort(reverse = True) :keyword arg 'reverse = True' is used to sort in descending order
